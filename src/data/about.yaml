    I’m Fiona, a fourth-year student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Graphic Design. I've completed two co-ops so far. My first co-op was at Radial Analytics, a small healthcare AI startup. As a designer and data scientist at Radial, I gained a passion for the ways effective utilization of data and design can improve the world around us.

    Last fall, I studied abroad in Bangkok, Thailand at Mahidol University. During my time there, I gained a love for travel and food. Although I haven't been able to travel since my semester abroad (thanks COVID), I've gained a love for trying new recipes as a way to "travel" and learn about new cultures from home. If I'm not working, I'm usually cooking or reading about recipes.
